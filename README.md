# robot32

Based on the provided plan, it seems that the student's project, named Robot32, is primarily focused on developing a website (Robot32.com) that features a helpful AI, particularly in the field of technology, robotics, and automation. The AI will be built using open-source large language models (LLMs) from Mistral, such as Mistral 7b, Mixtral 8x7b, and Mixtral 8x22b.

The website will have a chat interface, allowing users to interact with the AI. The AI's behavior will be customized using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and, in the future, possibly Lora training. These techniques help the AI to access and utilize relevant information during conversations, improving its ability to provide accurate and helpful responses.

While the project does not explicitly mention creating a physical robot for users to physically interact with, the AI on the Robot32 website will be able to provide guidance and resources for building hardware components, such as 'arms' and 'legs' for a robot. This way, the AI can assist users in creating their own physical robots by providing information and instructions.

Overall, the student's project aims to create a valuable and engaging web-based AI focused on technology, robotics, and automation, with a strong emphasis on open-source and customizable features.
